"Firstly: it’s huge. Secondly: it’s worth it. This may be true of many things in life, but particularly A Place of Greater Safety. Exploring the chemistry and innate tension between extremes of passion and reason, Mantel’s knack of conveying dizzying historical detail through engaging and complex characters is at its peak here. The reader’s life becomes entangled with three men who drove the French Revolution, and understanding what in turn drove them. Robespierre in particular is nowadays unavoidably associated with The Terror; but while you may shudder at his decisions, it is fascinating to see Mantel in his defence."
